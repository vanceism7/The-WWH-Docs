# WWH -- What, Why, How!?

# The Beginning -- What is WWH

## 1. What does it do?
WWH is a study method, note taking/documentation format, and knowledge sharing system!

WWH is an acronym which stands for three questions we ask ourselves when studying
1. What does it do?
2. Why do we use it/Why does it exist?
3. How does it work?

## 2. Why do we use it?
WWH is used for quickly wrapping your mind around huge amounts of information. It is meant to be a starting point on approaching new concepts, and then allows for quickly digging into the details without becoming overwhelmed or lost among the content. The guides we write using WWH can then be shared with others, allowing them to benefit from a simplistic, streamlined guide!

## 3. How does it work?
To Start, we look at new concepts from a birds eye view and just ask the three simple questions:

1. What does it do?
2. How does it do it?
3. Why does it do it/Why is it used?

When answering these questions, it is important to keep the answers as brief as possible. Only the how section is permitted to be of a greater length in order to accommodate for example content. How each section should be used specifically is described below:

---
### The *"What does it do"* section?
This section should only name off what the concept is/does. It's easy to fall into the temptation of writing the *why* content in the *what* section. A good tip to use is anything after the words "for" or "to" belongs in the *why* section. 

I.e: This what section: 
> What: "A plane is a flying vehicle used **_for_** traveling long distances"  

should really be:
> What: "A plane is a flying vehicle"  
Why: "It is used for traveling long distances"

---
### The *"Why does it exist?"* section
This section is self-explanatory, to name off why said concept exists. But an important detail to note here is that the *why* is usually a reference back to the bigger picture. When ever possible, it should name off which greater concept it's a part of.

I.e: (Let's say we're talking about a tire)
> Why: "Tires sit underneath **_cars_**, allowing them to travel smoothly and absorbing impact"

The car reference in this *why* section brings us up a level to it's parent-concept, a car, which in our study guide would have its own WWH section

---
### The *"How does it work?"* section
The how section is particularly important, as it presents us a gateway for digging deeper into the topic at hand. The how section should contain key-terms which in turn will get their own WWH section, in this way, the details can be examined without losing view of the bigger picture.

I.e: 
> How: A car helps us travel through the use of many components as follows:
> 1. *Internal Controls* - These are used to maneuver the vehicle
> 2. *The Engine* -  This provides the moving power of the vehicle
> 3. *Tires* - The car sits on top of 4 tires, providing balance and removing friction

Each of these sections named can then be easily the next subjects for digging deeper into how a car functions.

### Technically (a.k.a For the geeky people)
WWH is meant to take the shape of a tree-like data structure. 
- The what section defines what the node is
- The How section not only defines how it works, but also any child-nodes which support its function
- The why section should be a reference to how it supports its parent-node (except for the root).

In this way, we create a nice concept map of how everything links together.

In general, WWH meant to be used in a note-taking fashion. Although it is useful for focusing our study efforts, the real benefit comes from the concept map it creates once written down.

## Conclusion[^1] [^2] [^3]
So with all of that said, I will be using this repo to publish all of my note taking exploits as I continue to explore new technologies in programming. I hope that my efforts will help streamline the process of learning for others.

[^1]: Notice that I used the WWH format to explain what WWH is, the power is already at work!

[^2]: I realize this WWH is super simple, and not earth shattering or ground breaking in anyway, as well as a very common teaching used in elementary schools, but sometimes simple is better

[^3]: WWH is pronounced "Wahoo!", like "yahoo", but with a W...
